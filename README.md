# Description of the Site
A cool collaborative storytelling site where you can make some of the wackiest creative stories out there. Simply start it off by registering with the site and logging in. Then you can create your own story and see how other people bring it to life or add to other users' stories. However, be careful since you can only edit a story once and you can only see the previous update to the story while editing. On your homepage, you can see all of the stories you have contributed to in their entirety. Enjoy!
